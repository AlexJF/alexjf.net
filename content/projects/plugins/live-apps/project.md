Live Apps is a script for MSN Plus that automatically changes your Personal
Message, Display Picture and Status based on the applications you specify.

Based on AppMon+ by Alex P, Live Apps was developed to fix some critical bugs
and some annoyances on the original script aswell as providing it with new
functions such as the ability to add the application's caption (the text you
see on the titlebar) to your PSM.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

*Instructions*: Using Live Apps is pretty straight-forward. You download the file
below and then click on it. A window should pop-up asking if you want to import
the script. Click yes and it's all done.  To access the script functions click
on the brick-like button and navigate to the 'Live Apps' menu.

*Important Note*: For Live Apps to properly work you have to use the Display
Picture changer provided with the script when you want to change your default
DP.

Have fun :)
