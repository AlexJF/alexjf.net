MHDD Organizer is a Python application that allows the user to organize all
movies in one or more multimedia harddrives.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

Movie info can be automatically loaded from TMDB.

Main features:

* Handles multiple harddrives and multiple categories per harddrive.
* Automatic parsing of movie list in each category.
* Gets movie info from TMDB (www.tmdb.org)
* Caches the movie list locally in a database so you can check the list and
  edit movie info without needing to have the harddrive connected. The next
  time you connect it, changes are synced automatically.
* Supports movie covers.
