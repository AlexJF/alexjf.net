ALI - Auxiliar de Localização em Interiores (Interior Localization Helper) was
a university project for the course of Human-Computer Interaction (5th semester
at IST).

This fictional system could track every single object in your household and, as
such, help the user locating lost objects, set up stock depletion warnings for
goods such as milk or eggs and track the entries and exits of all known
objects.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

The main objective of the project was to develop an interface for this system
that could be used in an iPad-like device. We decided to use the Qt QML
framework since it seemed we could quickly create an original interface not
tied to the traditional OS-specific controls and since we could also make use
of the animation framework integrated in QML. It didn't disappoint ;)
