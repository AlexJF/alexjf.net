This project was created as an assigment for the Modelling course during my 6th
semester at IST.

In this project we were tasked with the modelling of a complex System of
Systems (SoS) responsible for weather monitoring.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

We did requirement elicitation; context mapping; UML use case and class
diagrams and scenario descriptions; SysML block definition, internal block and
sequence diagrams; component and deployment diagrams; and BPMN processes.
