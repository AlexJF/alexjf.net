L2 Max Launcher is an application which aimed to facilitate the life of the
players of the Lineage II private server L2Max.

It started as a simple server status checker and, over the course of the next
few months, it developed into a more complex application, providing automatic
updates (both to the game files and to the launcher), castle siege schedules,
online player count, raidboss status checker and vote reminder window.

I have stopped developing this application since I no longer play Lineage II.
Therefore, I cannot guarantee that the executable available for download below
remains functional since the server will probably change its structure over the
time.

As with all my projects, you're free to ask me any questions by using the
