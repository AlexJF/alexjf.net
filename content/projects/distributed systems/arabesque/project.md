Arabesque is a distributed graph mining system that enables quick and easy 
development of graph mining algorithms, while providing a scalable and efficient 
implementation that runs on top of Hadoop.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

This project was started at the [Qatar Computing Research Institute](http://qcri.org) and presented (by me)
at [SOSP 2015](http://www.ssrc.ucsc.edu/sosp15/) in Monterey, California.

Benefits of Arabesque:

* Simple intuitive API, tuned for Graph Mining Problems
* Handles all the complexity of Graph Mining Algorithms transparently
* Scalable to hundreds of machines
* Efficient implementation: negligible overhead compared to equivalent centralized solutions
* Support of large graphs with over a billion edges. It can process trillion of subgraphs in a commodity cluster.
* Designed for Hadoop. Runs as an Apache Giraph Job.
