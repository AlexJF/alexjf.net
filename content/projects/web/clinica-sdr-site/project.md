I was asked by Clínica São Domingos de Rana to design and build their new
website.

This website was to contain a description and history of the clinic, some
photos, a contact form and a list of doctors and other professionals that
provided services in the clinic. It was also to contain detailed information
regarding the working schedule of each doctor and/or practice.

Unfortunately, the project ended up being cencelled due to financial concerns.
