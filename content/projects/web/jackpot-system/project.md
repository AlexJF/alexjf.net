A custom jackpot system ordered by DGBux (a PTC site) whose purpose is to allow
users to buy tickets. When all tickets get bought, a specified number of
winning tickets are automatically drawn and the prizes are added to the user
account.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

All jackpot info (including prizes) is edited in the DB so it is truly dynamic
and the owner can create as many jackpots as he'd like. It also saves
information regarding previous jackpots.

PHP, CSS, Javascript and a MySQL database were used in the development of this
script.
