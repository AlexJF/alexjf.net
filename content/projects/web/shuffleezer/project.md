A Web app to allow the automatic creation of a Deezer playlist containing a random
sample of all tracks in a set of Deezer playlists.

Developed with AngularJS, Bootstrap and the Deezer Web API.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

Cool use cases:

* Limit the size of your offline-saved collection by offline-saving a random
  limited-size sample from your music library.
* Shuffle the order of the tracks in a playlist in a permanent and truly random way. 
* Join several playlists together without duplicates or remove duplicates from
  a single playlist.
