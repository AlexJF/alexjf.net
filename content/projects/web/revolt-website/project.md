My previous website, developed by me from the ground up using PHP, CSS and
XHTML linked to a MySQL database using approximately 8.5k lines of code.

It contained a blog and project section just like this one, as well as a list
of interesting links and a virtual file manager/uploader for my own personal
use. Each and every section was editable from a backoffice administration
interface.

I also used several external modules such as
[Geshi](http://qbnz.com/highlighter/), [Highslide JS](http://highslide.com/)
and [TinyMce Editor](http://www.tinymce.com/).
