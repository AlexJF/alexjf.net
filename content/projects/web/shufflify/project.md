A Web app to allow the automatic creation of a Spotify playlist containing a random
sample of all tracks in a set of Spotify sources (either 'Your music' library or other
playlists).

Developed with AngularJS, Bootstrap and the Spotify Web API.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

Cool use cases:

* Work around the 3333 offline-saved songs per-device by choosing a random 3333
  track sample from your music library.
* Limit the size of your offline-saved collection by offline-saving a random
  limited-size sample from your music library.
* Shuffle the order of the tracks in a playlist in a truly random way (not
  according to Spotify's sometimes weird randomness that plays the same track
  several times).
* Join several playlists together without duplicates or remove duplicates from
  a single playlist.
