Title: Site back online
Logo: {static images/serverracks3.jpg}

After almost 2 months of downtime, my website is finally back online!

The friend with which I had it hosted cancelled his contract and I was forced
to get a server of my own. Unfortunately, OVH grossly underestimated the
interest on their new server offers and was unable to meet supply, delaying
server deliveries for up to 2 months (as was my case). But now that I have it
and everything is configured, things should go more smoothly.
<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

I've also started adding some of my other university projects to the projects
section and hope to, in the next few days, have an article regarding my move to
Stockholm and the first 2 months here.

See you soon!
