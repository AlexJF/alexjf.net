As usual, I get distracted with lots of other things and end up neglecting this
blog. Fortunately, February only had 28 days so my "little" delay is not as big
as it appears. Anyway, a lot has happened since my last post so lets get to it
shall we?

Ok so last time I interacted with you fine crowd I was getting ready for my
snow trip to Vall de Núria. I'm happy to say that it was an awesome experience!
Besides getting to meet the great EMDC group currently in Lisbon (hail to you
guys!), some very nice ladies from the previous EMDC batch currently working on
their thesis and the main coordinators of the Master's degree, it was also my
first experience with abundant snow. I had been in Serra da Estrela before
(that's the highest mountain range in continental Portugal) where there is
usually some snow (though not that much when I went there). In Vall de Núria,
we had up to (or should I say down to?) -15ºC and rather strong winds which
provided some awesome white flurry causing temporary where-the-hell-am-I?
situations.

During our stay there we had some presentations by previous students,
coordinators and teachers regarding interesting subjects related to the area of
Distributed Systems along with what we should expect from our life in Sweden.
Each of us also gave their own presentation explaining who we were and what our
interests are. Besides the presentations, we had a lot of fun playing [Werewolf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werewolf_(game)),
pool and other activities. The breakfasts, lunches and dinners were very nice,
following a buffet-style first-plate followed by an 'a la carte' second-plate.
As for the actual skiing, I equipped myself thoroughly for that adventure on my
second day there along with some other brave souls. In total we were 4 (2
skiing veterans and 2 newbies - yey me!). Why so few and why brave you ask?
Well, turns out that was a particularly bad day for skiing with winds up to
around 60km/h and heavy snowing. There literally were times when I couldn't see
anything around me (the fact that I forgot my glasses on the room didn't help
either lol) and the skis hardly slided with all the fresh snow piling up fast.
After about 30 mins I went back inside as my eyelids were starting to freeze to
one another.

We left Vall de Núria on Friday, the 8th of February around lunch. When we were
at the intermediate station waiting for the train to Barcelona, I noticed I
hadn't returned the key card used to open our room. Quite worried that I might
have to return back to the hotel, I phoned a friend that was still there and
everything turned out to be okay. Still have the key card in my wallet, you
never know when it might come in handy.

Next monday, the second semester classes officially started. These are my
subjects for this semester: Cloud Computing, Supercomputer Architectures,
Decentralized Systems, Network Optimization, Sensors and Wireless
communication. Fortunately, this semester has a bigger focus on continuous
evaluation with weekly paper readings and reviewings (ok this part sucks),
presentations and a greater emphasis on projects. If I'm not mistaken, we'll
only have 1 small exam at the end so it should be a lot less stressful. As for
the actual content, I'd say they are ok. The Sensors and Wireless subject is
rather strange in that it has been interesting but up until now I haven't seen
that much relevance with the actual area of Distributed Systems (we've been
studying how accelerometers, gyroscopes and other sensors you can find on your
smartphone work). I'd say the one I'm disappointed with the most up until now
is maybe Decentralized Systems but truth be told, the main components of the
course (the project and the report) haven't started yet.


We also found this very cool bowling place near the university. From the 3
games we played the time I went there, I won 1 so it wasn't so bad. I also got
a free extra burger since the waiter took half of my previous burger away when
it was my turn to play. Also went with one of the EMDC guys from the
previous batch to a free flamenco show in Grácia. I'm not an expert in flamenco
but the performance seemed to be very good! And right next door there's one of
the [best burger places](http://www.2hburger.com/) I've tried here in Barcelona. Have to go there again
soon!

This last week it rained a lot here in Barcelona which meant that I could no
longer bike to the university and had to shell out some money for the tram.
Fortunately, the rain has given way to a very nice warm sun which helps to lift
spirits.

Finally, lets talk about my new toy: the [Nexus 4](http://www.google.com/intl/all/nexus/4/). I had ordered it through a
friend (thanks again) since Google doesn't accept payment with credit
cards outside of the country of purchase (I don't have a Spanish bank account).
This was at the beginning of February but the delays that plagued the Nexus 4
delivery along with some mixups during the actual expedition resulted in me
receiving the phone only on the 27th. I must say I'm loving it and when I now
look at my previous phone (a [LG-P500](http://www.gsmarena.com/lg_optimus_one_p500-3516.php)), I wonder how I could ever have lived
with such a small screen. The arrival of the Nexus 4 also gave me a much needed
boost to finish the first version of my expense tracker application [Track My
Money](http://www.alexjf.net/projects/android/track-my-money) since the app I was previously using doesn't work with Jellybean. After a
weekend filled with a lot of coding and debugging I release the first official
version of the app last Monday and released it to the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.alexjf.tmm). Check it out
and give a review! smiley

I'm going back to Portugal on the 25th of March and besides visiting my family
in Portugal, I'll also see my father who's arriving on the 24th. I also have to
remember to bring my running gear to Barcelona so I can resume my 1 hour and a
half runs now that the weather is more favourable.
