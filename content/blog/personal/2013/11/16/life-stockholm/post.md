I arrived in Stockholm on the 15th of August and I must say I've enjoyed
immensely these 3 months I've already spent here. The EMDC master programme I'm
following has you move between at least 2 different countries during the
master. If you're not new to this blog, you already know that my first year was
spent in Barcelona, studying at Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya. For my
second year, I'm to study at KTH Royal Institute of Technology here in
Stockholm.
<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

Although classes only started at the beginning of September, I chose to arrive
on the 15th not only to have 2 weeks to get accustomed to living in this new
country but also because the EMDC summer event was to happen on the 20th to
22th of August. Much like what happened in the winter event I described [in an
earlier post](http://www.alexjf.net/blog/personal/new-semester), in this summer event, all the students of the current EMDC batch
along with some select students from the previous batches, teachers and
coordinators gathered together for 3 days of relaxation, socialization and
getting to know some interesting research topics in the field of distributed
systems. Similarly to previous years, this year's summer event was also
organized at Fejan, a small island in the archipelago to the northeast of
Stockholm. Everything from the great food served (tried moose for the first
time!) right next to the water to the traditional swedish sauna followed by a
dive in the cold water was amazing. We also had time for a night walk around
Fejan, kayaking around the neighbourly islands and to play some volleyball
after a tiring day. The feeling of being totally immersed in the surrounding
nature is exhilarating.

This immersion with nature is actually a constant here in Stockholm. Being one
of the cities referred to as 'Venice of the North', it's guaranteed that you're
never too far away from a canal, river, lake, sea. The distinction between
those concepts is actually not so clear because when you look at a map of
Stockholm and the surrounding areas, it appears that Stockholm is just a
collection of big islands. But, as I was saying, the city is totally integrated
with nature, so much so that you happen to have an entire national park
spanning more than 10km around and through the city. In less than 20 minutes
(and just using public transportation and walking) you can get from the city
centre, with its high buildings and offices to the middle of an entire forest
surrounded by nothing but trees, shrubs, birds and the occasional deer.

I'm currently living in Lappis, a famous neighbourhood dominated by student
housing and about 15 minutes away from the main KTH campus (or 20 from
T-Centralen, the central metro station). Most of the rooms here are integrated
into corridors containing between 8 and 14 rooms. Each room has a private
bathroom and the kitchen is shared by the entire corridor. My own corridor is
one of the big ones with 13 people currently living here. Curiously, only 3 of
those people are Swedish with the remaining ones coming from all over the
world: India, Hungary, Germany, China, France, and others. Fortunately,
everyone is really nice although some of them are rarely seen outside their
rooms. All my colleagues from UPC are also living in Lappis (albeit in
different buildings) as well as some of the ones that studied in IST. The
remaining ones got accommodations in Kista, where the technological KTH campus
is located (approximately 1 hour away from Lappis and where I have most of my
classes).

My room here is quite bigger than the one I had in Barcelona (about twice,
almost triple the size). The 3 windows look over the Lappis forest which, by
the way, is an awesome place to go running: fresh air, next to the sea and lots
of different tracks. On my first few days here I made the obligatory trip to
IKEA to get some bed sheets, towels and some furniture to put in my room and
bathroom. The bathroom is pretty simple and quite different from the bathrooms
I've grown accustomed to: there's no separation between the shower and the rest
of the bathroom (I had to put a curtain to keep the water from going all over
the place) and there's a single tap which you can direct either to the sink or
to the shower. The shared kitchen is pretty big with 2 of everything: ovens,
fridges, freezers, sinks. You also have 2 cupboards (one of them with a lock)
and a drawer reserved for each room so there's plenty of space.

The transportation system is pretty great. You buy a single card (SL card),
charge it and can use it everywhere in Stockholm: buses, metro, train, ferries,
etc. A 30 month pass is quite expensive: 520 SEK with the student discount, 790
SEK without (close to 60 and 90€ respectively). Everything's usually on time
and there are plenty of buses around with great coverage. The metro network is
also pretty extensive.

As for the university itself, KTH, the main campus has a very old-school look
(kinda reminds me of a brick-version of Hogwarts). The Kista campus looks more
modern but also has less charm. This semester I'm having 4 classes: Philosophy
of Science, Academic Writing, Advanced Topics in Distributed Systems,
Implementation of Distributed Systems. The Philosophy course has already
finished and although I was very reluctant to take it at first, I ended up
enjoying it thorougly!  We did lots of reading on some essays by philosophers
of science like Kuhn, Popper, Lakatos, Longino, had 4 seminars/discussions and
had to write an original essay with at most 10 pages for evaluation (you can
check mine in the attachment to this post). The other courses are still going
strong: for the implementation course, Anh and I are evaluating distributed
genome sequence alignment tools; for the advanced topics we are currently
preparing a presentation on the modelling of network interactions through
markets (buyer-broker-seller interactions); and for academic writing we're
studying how to write the different sections of a scientific paper.

This post is getting quite long so I'll leave it at that. On the following post
I'll highlight some of the cool stuff I did here and explain my experience in
finding a nice thesis and its implications.

Cya in the next post!
