Title: Qatar Adventure
Logo: {static images/cover.jpg}

I've just about given up trying to keep regular personal updates on my blog.
Something always comes up to take my attention and what were initially days of
delay end up becoming months. Besides, it's not like I particularly enjoy
writing or anything like that :P. Anyway, some people have asked me what I've been
up to recently and the truth is that it's well past time I added some new
content to the site. So here it is!!

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

# Thesis and Vacations
So back in March 2014, I was at Telefónica Research, in Barcelona, fully
focused on my master thesis regarding incremental graph processing. I'm happy to
say that everything went well on that end and I successfully defended it at the
beginning of July. You can check out the result [here](http://www.alexjf.net/projects/thesis/optimizing-synchronous-online-computation-graphs/).

After that, I went back to Portugal to enjoy some very anticipated vacations and think
about what I wanted to do next. I won't get into details regarding this as it would
add considerable length to this post. Suffice it to say that after a couple of months
I received an excellent offer from Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI) to come to Doha
and work as a Research Associate. After receiving this offer, I needed an extra couple
of months to procure all the necessary documentation (criminal record, master degree
certificate, etc.). Finally, at the beginning of December, I received my work visa
and plane ticket and was ready to start this new journey!

# Qatar
## Arrival and setup
After a 6-hour trip from Barcelona, on the 12th of December, I finally arrived
at Hamad International Airport in Doha. Quickly went through the immigration
controls and found the driver that would take me to my accomodation. Because it
was already quite late (midnight something), the roads were empty so we made
excellent time and got from the airport to the Ezdan Hotel (where I'm currently
staying) in just under 20 minutes. 

Ezdan is located in the West Bay district in Doha, the one with all the nice 
skyscrappers. It is actually in a pretty nice location, with 2 shopping malls (and
a Carrefour) very close by. It is also very close to the main boulevard by the sea
(Corniche) where I have my walks and runs. And the cherry on top of the cake is
the fact that it is just 10 minutes away from the office by foot. My apartment 
itself is a single room (bed + couches + kitchenette) plus a small bathroom.
Not luxurious at all but very practical and quite big. In fact, I think this single
room might be as big as my entire apartment back in Barcelona! And of course the hotel
has a swimming pool and a gym (even a local supermarket although quite expensive), so 
I'm overall extremely happy with my little "home".

</p>

During the first week I was quite busy with the initial work and residency paperwork.
Also had to undergo a medical examination (complete with blood test, god I hate those!)
in order to get the residence ID. Fortunately, everything was pre-arranged by Qatar
Foundation (parent entity of QCRI) so I just had to follow the arranged schedule and
things went very smoothly. I've heard that this is not always the case and some companies
don't guide you as much during this process so if you get a job in Doha try to clarify 
this with your employer.

## Transportation
Regarding transportation, most expats living in Doha get a car to move around
(either rent/lease or buy). Up until now, I've actually managed to survive
without a car, which is a good thing because Doha's traffic is horrendous! They
are constantly improving road layouts and working in a metro system so
hopefully this situation will become less severe in a few years. Lets see if I
can survive the summer without a car too! 

Since everything I need is relatively close by, my legs are my main means of
transportation. For the occasional trips to more distant places or when
carrying a lot of shopping bags, there's very good taxi coverage: Karwa, the
local official taxi company; unnofficial taxis by individuals; and Uber. I've
had good experiences with all of them.  I've also seen some buses moving around
but never tried them myself. I've heard the route coverage and scheduling could
be better though.

## Weather

I've been pleasantly surprised with the weather up until now. The idea I had of
Doha was of this hot furnace all year round with temperatures between 30 and 50
degrees. While this might indeed be true during the Summer months (plus the
extreme humidity or so I've been told), the Winter months (December, January and
February) were actually quite mild. There were weeks where we had minimums and
maximums of respectively 12 and 16. Some occasional spikes to mid-twenties or
even 35 on this particularly hot day but very tolerable I might say. Of course,
I expect this will totally change during the Summer so I'll provide a relevant
update when that time comes.

Besides temperatures, there are also other things to worry about related to
weather.  Since I've arrived, I've witnessed 2 or 3 very mild sandstorms. These
tend to occur whenever wind speed goes over a certain threshold and can be
quite unpredictable. I remember this one time we went out for lunch to the
closest mall to the office and when we came out visibility was reduced to a few
hundred meters and you could actually feel little grains of sand hitting your
face (I wear glasses so had my eyes kinda covered). Other than that, humidity is
the other factor to worry about. I've already experienced some quite humid days,
specially along the seaside boulevard and I was told that things will only get
worse the nearer we get to August.

## Work
As I've mentioned, I'm now working at the Qatar Computing Research Institute
(QCRI).  In particular, I've joined the Distributed Systems team and am working
primarily on distributed graph mining and analytics systems (including the
system I worked with during my master thesis). Been enjoying it tremendously
and the people are amazing! Felt integrated from the start.

QCRI is located at the Tornado Tower, also in West Bay. It's a stylish 
building and easy to spot from the distance with its own particular shape. My
particular desk is pretty standard, although I do like the fact that it has this
glass part on the wall that essentially serves as a small whiteboard and which is
super practical to jot down some ideas. I got a dual monitor setup and a DELL XPS
which is very similar, if not identical, to the one I had back at Telefónica in 
Barcelona (12 gigs of RAM, Nvidia GTX 750, i7 3.4Ghz, 2TB disk) so I can easily
run a local virtualized Hadoop cluster for debugging without seeing things slow to
a crawl.

There's one thing I miss from Telefónica though: Cupcake Friday. That has
to become a thing here as well to spice up productivity (and belly sizes :P).

## Language
Now one of the things I've been trying to do during all these travels and moves is
to get to actually try and learn the native language. For Spanish, I had 1 year of
classes before actually moving there for my master and it was relatively easy to
pick up given the similarities of Portuguese. For Swedish, I did make the initial 
effort but the learning environment that we were provided with was an auditorium full
with something close to 300 students. I do not see this as a good setup to learning
any language and since I ended up staying a little less than 6 months anyway, no real
harm done.

Having arrived in Qatar, one thing I noticed is that everyone talks English (to varying
degrees of proficiency but enough to be understood), from the people in the taxis, to
people at supermarkets and restaurants and your work place. In my particular case, I have
no requirement at all to know Arabic for any of my day to day stuff but I imagine that
someone with a more customer-facing job might have a different experience in this regard.

In any case, I still wanted to make the effort to learn, at least, the very basics of
Arabic: letters, numbers, some vocabulary and sentences. It turns out that the Arabic
Language Technologies group at QCRI holds biweekly Arabic classes for QCRI employees
free of charge so I tried to join in on that. However, they had already had 10 classes
so I felt a bit adrift and didn't really want to do all that effort to catch up
individually at home. Fortunately, Arabic classes at Fanar, the Qatar Islamic
Cultural Center located near to Souq Waqif, were scheduled to start in January
so I just registered with them for a level 1 course. You pay 300QAR (other schools
asked for as much as 2800QAR) for biweekly 1.5 hour classes over the course of 2 months
or so. 

<p class="float-right-sm center-text">
<a class="image-box" href="{static images/IMG_20150206_195704.jpg}" title="Numbers in arabic">
<img src="{static images/IMG_20150206_195704.jpg thumb=220x165}" alt="Numbers in arabic">
</a>
</p>

We are now well past the middle of the course and I must say I've learnt a lot! You do
have to put some effort at home so you don't fall behind as the rhythm is quite franctic
(the first day we learnt 4 consonants and all the vowel sounds along with the initial
greetings and "how do you do?" kind of things). It does get somewhat smoother after that
initial shock but I guess the vocabulary count up till now is close to the 200 words (of 
which I've only been able to memorize a very small subset). We are now learning verbs and
plurals for which rules seem to be nonexistent or all over the place. I do start to identify
some patterns but it's slow-going. I admit to having some difficulty with the pronunciation:
there are 4 differents type of "d" and 2 types of "t" which I can't really distinguish between
as well all these throat and nosal sounds that I'm slowly getting accostumed to. The writing,
however, I love it!!! It's just so different and elegant!

Not sure if I'll be continuing on to level 2 as it does require some serious time commitment to
be able to learn successfully but I think level 1 is something everyone should try to do.
Not only you start understanding signs and being able to recognize some meanings in arabic
texts and conversations but you also find out some interesting facts about the culture and
religion during the classes. I've heard some people complain that at Fanar they try to
impose their religion on you and, while there were some classes where the teacher spoke a
lot about the Quran, I've really come to see it as interesting and culturarly relevant
asides and considerations that really do enrich the experience if you keep an open mind.

## Free times, fun
Finally, we come to another question I also got asked a lot after having moved here:
"But isn't it boring over there?". While the answer to this is something that greatly
depends on your individual personality, I must say that ever since I arrived there wasn't
a single day that I could classify as boring or as wasted. 

One of the things you might miss in Doha, for instance, is the nightlife. This is specially
true if you come from Barcelona or Lisbon where you simply have to walk a few streets to 
find some random event, nice bar with live music, discos, etc. At least, in West Bay, the
area I spend the most time, the only place you can find something similar is inside the
hotels and this usually means you'll have to be able to pay premium. I suspect that one of
the biggest reasons for this is the negative conotation associated with alcohol in Qatar
and other Arabic countries. In fact, with the exception of some hotels, you can only buy
alcohol if you have a special permit and, even so, only at a special shop (which I guess
is government regulated but not sure how that works).

That is not to say people consistently spend their nights at home. There are
several restaurants and cafes where you can enjoy some nice drinks
(alcohol-free of course), foods and shisha (water pipes). Souq Waqif (the traditional
market) and, to a lesser extent, Katara are 2 places where you can find an
unusually large amount of this kind of night activity.  People also go out for
leisury strolls and to enjoy the amazing views along some of the seaside
boulevards like the Corniche and, again, Katara. I've also spent some of my
Saturday nights attending classical music concerts performed by the [Qatar 
Philarmonic Orchestra](http://qatarphilharmonicorchestra.org) at the Katara Cultural
Village and have enjoyed them tremendously.

Malls are also a big part of the local pastimes. They usually fill up with people
after work and/or during weekends just doing their shopping or just strolling around
with friends. Each of the big malls has a fun center and cinemas. Some also offer
more unique experiences. In Villagio, for instance, you can take a gondola ride along
the artificial river that cuts the mall in half. On the other hand, in City Centre,
you have a bowling alley and an ice skating rink.

Doha also has quite a nice collection of parks and green areas. I was expecting
the city to be more barren on that regard but was pleasantly surprised. Not sure how
well the vegetation survives the harsh summer but I guess I'll see it soon enough.
Anyway, parks are another favorite destination of people living here, specially 
families. It also has quite a few beaches but you have to be mindful that most
are either privately owned by hotels/condos or are restricted to families so
you might have to go further away from the city. I've just been to one of the beaches
in Pearl with some friends (2 of them lived there) and I must say the water was
phenomenal (and full of fish of various sizes).

Qatar has also been trying to promote a lot of sports events lately. I myself
attended one of the matches of the Handball World Championship which was then followed
by a live concert by Gwen Steffani. Since the start of the year, Doha has also hosted
the Qatar Total Open (tennis) and there's currently an event related to equestrian
sports. I think there was also a golf championship, the Qatar Masters or something
like that. There are also quite a few different types of water sports you can do if you're
so inclined. Just the other week, some friends and I rented a small sail boat and sailed
for a few hours. That ended up being quite an adventure due to the strong wind and the fact
that the boat had a leak somewhere and we noticed it was starting to sink. Fortunately, we
reached shore soon after so there was no major problem (although my phone did have a swim).
I've also been slowly getting back into shape with my weekly runs and gym sessions.

Another very popular attraction, and the most unique experience I've had here so far, is
the desert. I've only been there once with a mid-day excursion but I look forward to
returning there sometime. During this excursion, we did some dune surfing/bashing in
SUVs; stopped at some spots with a particularly nice view for photos and just fooling
around in the sand; and ended up spending the evening in these nice traditional tents and
eating a magnificent BBQ. Although I went with an excursion, if you own (or rent) a SUV,
you can go on your own (well, better in a group in case anything happens). In fact, most of
the locals seem to drive SUVs and, during the weekends with particularly nice weather, you 
can count on them going for some trips to the desert.

Finally, every other month a new convention seems to pop-up at the Qatar
National Convention Centre. In February, I went to the Qatar Motorshow where
major car dealers showcased their latest (and not so latest) models. So that was pretty 
fun. They've also had (not sure if it's still going on at the time of writing) another
convention but this time related to jewelry, watches and all sorts of luxury accessories
and items. I didn't go to that one myself but I've heard it was at least twice as big
as the motorshow.

So as you see, I've been keeping pretty busy. I'm running out of things to talk
about but that might just be for the best because this post seems to have
become rather lengthy. Anyway, feel free to ask for any other details you might
want to ask to satisfy your curiosity. Or if you actually live in Doha, I'd love to 
meet you sometime!

Cheers!
