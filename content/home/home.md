Description: Personal website of Alexandre Jorge Fonseca

Welcome to my website!

My name is Alexandre Fonseca and I'm currently a Research Associate at [QCRI](http://qcri.org.qa/) focusing on Distributed Systems.

This site's main purpose is to constitute my personal web presence. Here you will be able to learn who I am, what projects I am/was involved in as well as just check some rambling posts on my blog.

Also, feel free to contact me regarding any collaborations, help or feedback. You can reach me using the contact form on this website.
