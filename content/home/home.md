Welcome to the newest version of my website!

My name is Alexandre Fonseca and I'm a Computer Science and Engineering student with a great interest in Distributed Computing/Systems.

This site's main purpose is to constitute my personal web presence. Here you will be able to learn who I am, what projects I am/was involved in as well as just check some rambling posts on my blog.

I'm also open to collaboration in new projects, job offers, internship proposals and just about anything. You can reach me using the contact form on this website.
